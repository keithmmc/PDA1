# PDA1
 
This repository contains my submission for the Programming for Data Analysis module at ATU as part of the Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics.

Assignment Brief:
The objective of this project is:

1. Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my own choosing based on at least 100 data points across a minimum of four variables.
2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
4. Detail research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook.

Readme file

Python 3 was used to develop this project and is needed to run the code in the notebook. Python 3 can be downloaded from the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or using the Anaconda Python distribution at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.

The Jupyter Notebook PfDA_Assignment.ipynb can be viewed directly in this GitHub repository in a browser without Python 3 being installed. If the repository is downloaded it can be run locally by navigating to the folder and entering the command jupyter lab or jupyter notebook on the command line. This will open Jupyter in the browser.

The main python libraries used are pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot and numpy. These are loaded at the start of the code. The code should be run from top to bottom.
